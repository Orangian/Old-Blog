Hello! My name is Ty Ethan Sayahi. I am in sixth grade. Some of my hobbies are, technology, robotics and programming. I love working with computers and other tech related things. I actually built my first computer on my own when I was only 9 years old. I built my second computer the following year. I really like programming. Im not that good at it, and I currently need my brothers help to actually create something, however when I browse the code of the website he made for me, I always learn new things. I also like working with robots. I dont get to do this often however, as robotics kits are expensive.
