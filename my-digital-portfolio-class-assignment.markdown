Hello! My name is Ty Ethan Sayahi. I am in sixth grade and am currently attending Summit Elementary in Cincinnati, OH. Some of my hobbies include working on computers, robotics, and programming. I love working with computers and other technology related things. I actually built my first computer on my own when I was only ten years old. I built my second computer the following year. I really like programming, however, I'm not that good at it and currently need my brother's help to actually create something. Although that may be the case, when I browse the code of the website he made for me I always learn new things. I also really like working with robots, however, I don't get to do this often as robotics kits are expensive.
