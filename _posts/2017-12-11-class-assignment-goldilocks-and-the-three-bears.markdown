So, we watched this video about the fictional story "Goldilocks" and we have to write about what crimes Goldilocks committed. I think she committed these crimes, Breaking and entering, criminal trespassing,  vandalism, destruction of private property, theft, and causing a panic. She caused a panic by scaring the family, she committed vandalism and destroyed private property by breaking the chair, she broke and entered and trespassed by being in their house, and she stole the porridge. Her parents also endangered a child by allowing here to roam freely in a forest with BEARS living in it.
