MGSV: TPP is a good game. Well, it starts out good, at least. The story is good for most of the game until the missions are just harder versions of previous missions. The "Buddy" D-Horse controls clunkily, and "Quiet" is insanely hard to beat in the boss fight but loses most of her abilities when she becomes your "Buddy". The fact that getting Huey is only a side op is also not a good choice. In total, I give the game a 6/10. The game has good mechanics, but Kojima really screwed the pooch on this game.
